## Requirement Description

I want to get specific data from a CSV file. This way, I can find the right person for assign based on the conditions. The fields I require may change dynamically based on the actual situation. 

### Key Points

- **Dynamic Field Selection**: The solution should allow for selecting fields from the CSV file based on user input, as the required fields may vary each time.

- **Flexibility**: The implementation should handle any changes in the column structure of the CSV file, ensuring it can adapt to different datasets.

### Expected Outcome

The final solution should enable users to query data they want, process the CSV file accordingly, and return the relevant data while maintaining flexibility for future changes.
